# homebrew-formulae

Resurrecting dead and obsolete Homebrew formulae for my own use.

## `sublime-text3`

`sublime-text` was [updated][st4] to version 4 in May 2021, which is a paid
upgrade from version 3. The official `homebrew-cask-versions` tap has a cask for
[`sublime-text2`][st2], but not 3.

[st2]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions/blob/HEAD/Casks/sublime-text2.rb
[st4]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/106089

## `unrar`

`unrar` was [removed](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/66609) from
Homebrew in December 2020 because it's not open source software.
